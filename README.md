# FL Patcher Presets
Presets for FL Studio Patcher.

These presets use existing plugins to produce new effects.

## Doom Compressor
[Mick Gordon talked about his Doom Compressor on stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7YJcVuxuAQ).

I recreated it using a flat curve in Maximus, which compresses everything to 0 dB.

## Doom Compressor 2
I improved the Doom Compressor by adding attack, sustain, release, and dry/wet controls.

## Mid/Side Monitor
This single knob monitor is useful for quickly checking the contents of your mix.

## Mid/Side Panner
I improved the Mid/Side Monitor by adding left/right panning.

This is useful for spatial effects, such as moving drums close and to the right, or guitars far and to the left.

## Mid/Side Filter
This filter combines mid/side separation with two opposing lowpass/highpass filters for spatial effects.

## Mid/Side EQ
This is identical to the default Mid/Side EQ preset, except with linear phase and oversampling enabled.
